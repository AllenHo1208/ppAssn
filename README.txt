You need to deploy your solution on the cloud using any free Cloud application platforms of your choice and share the url with me where we can try out your integration. Please upload your source code to GitHub and share that link too. 
 
I would like you to validate your code for the following use case as well. i.e. a buyer’s PayPal account does not have sufficient funding. How would your code handle it.
